    <p style="font-family: swissl">matireal is a tire-based geo-textile transforming an environmental nightmare into an ecological dream.   matireal is a simple, hands on solution that can repurpose used tires locally to construct permeable surfaces.   This innovation was derived out of a relationship to linear site a Milwaukee, ideas from neighbors, and months of experimentation with the automobile tire.<br><br> 

After running a successful <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/keith-hayes/matireal-a-creational-trail"><span style="font-family: swissl; color: #52904D;">kickstarter</span></a>, the first matireal prototype was completed in 2013.  It is a 350 foot path at 6 feet wide that's become a catalyst to create pedestrian access to an bridge that was formerly inaccessible.  It was made with 1400 discarded tires from within a 2 mile radius of the site.<br><br>  

Our primary partners in this initial prototype are Earthbound Development, Milwaukee Electric Tool, the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources, and the City of Milwaukee.  The realization of this path was made feasible by the hands and hard work of many volunteers and 230 micro investors who pledged to support this experimental transformation of hazardous waste into local resource.<br><br>

This permeable, replicable, trail blazing system has the potential not only bring manufacturing jobs back to Milwaukee, but can become a national benchmark for forlorn industrial infrastructure where those opportunities once supported a flourishing neighborhood, too often blighted now.<br><br>  

matireal is initiating a broader dialogue for car-centric cities to contribute to developing countries worldwide. It has already been applied to roadways being built in Nigeria.  Through the continued research and development, and matirealization of this concept, beintween aspires to co-produce local motion, using our minds to innovate, and our hands to co-produce models that are socially, economically, and ecologically sustainable.</p>
